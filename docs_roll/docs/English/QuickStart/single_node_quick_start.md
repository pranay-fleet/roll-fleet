# Quick Start: Single-Node Deployment Guide

## Environment Preparation
1. Purchase a machine equipped with GPU and install GPU drivers synchronously
2. Connect to the GPU instance remotely and enter the machine terminal
3. Run the following command to install the Docker environment and NVIDIA container toolkit
```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/alibaba/ROLL/blob/main/scripts/install_docker_nvidia_container_toolkit.sh | sudo bash
```

## Environment Configuration
Choose your desired Docker image from the [image addresses](https://alibaba.github.io/ROLL/docs/English/QuickStart/image_address). The following example uses *torch2.6.0 + vLLM0.8.4*
```shell
# 1. Start a Docker container with GPU support, expose container ports, and keep the container running
sudo docker run -dit \
  --gpus all \
  -p 9001:22 \
  --ipc=host \
  --shm-size=10gb \
  roll-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/roll/pytorch:nvcr-24.05-py3-torch260-vllm084 \
  /bin/bash

# 2. Enter the Docker container
#    You can use the `sudo docker ps` command to find the running container ID or name.
sudo docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

# 3. Verify that GPUs are visible
nvidia-smi

# 4. Clone the project code
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/ROLL.git

# 5. Install project dependencies (choose the requirements file corresponding to your image)
cd ROLL
pip install -r requirements_torch260_vllm.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
```

## Pipeline Execution
```shell
bash examples/agentic_demo/run_agentic_pipeline_frozen_lake_single_node_demo.sh
```
