# Trackers and Metrics

The ROLL framework supports multiple experiment tracking tools to help you monitor and analyze the training process. This document will provide detailed instructions on how to configure and use these trackers.

## Supported Trackers

The ROLL framework currently supports the following trackers:

1. **TensorBoard** - Visualization tool developed by Google
2. **Weights & Biases (WandB)** - Powerful machine learning experiment tracking platform
3. **SwanLab** - Next-generation AI experiment tracking tool
4. **Stdout** - Direct output to standard output

## Configuring Trackers

In the YAML configuration file, trackers are configured through the `track_with` and `tracker_kwargs` parameters:

```yaml
# Using TensorBoard
track_with: tensorboard
tracker_kwargs:
  log_dir: /path/to/tensorboard/logs

# Using Weights & Biases
track_with: wandb
tracker_kwargs:
  api_key: your_wandb_api_key
  project: your_project_name
  name: experiment_name
  notes: "Experiment description"
  tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2

# Using SwanLab
track_with: swanlab
tracker_kwargs:
  login_kwargs:
    api_key: your_swanlab_api_key
  project: your_project_name
  logdir: /path/to/swanlab/logs

## Metric Monitoring

The ROLL framework automatically records the following types of metrics:

## Algorithm Performance Metrics

### Validation Phase
- val/score/mean: Average score per episode during validation phase. Reflects the model's average performance on unseen environments.
- val/score/max / val/score/min: Maximum / minimum score per episode during validation phase.

### Value Related
- critic/lr: Learning rate of the value function (Critic). The learning rate is the step size for optimizer updates to model parameters.
- critic/loss: Loss between value network predictions and actual returns.
- critic/value: Mean of value network predictions for batch states at the beginning of data collection or training. These values are typically used as baselines when calculating advantage functions.
- critic/vpred: Mean of value network predictions for batch states in the current optimization. This value updates with training iterations.
- critic/clipfrac: Whether value function clipping (value_clip) was used and the proportion of clipping effectiveness.
- critic/error: Mean squared error between value network predictions and actual returns.

### Reward Related
- critic/score/mean: Mean of raw environment rewards.
- critic/score/max / critic/score/min: Maximum / minimum of raw environment rewards.
- critic/rewards/mean: Mean of normalized/clipped rewards.
- critic/rewards/max / critic/rewards/min: Maximum / minimum of normalized/clipped rewards.
- critic/advantages/mean: Mean of advantages. Reflects how much extra reward taking a specific action in a given state brings compared to the average level.
- critic/advantages/max / critic/advantages/min: Maximum / minimum of advantages.
- critic/returns/mean: Mean of returns. Expected cumulative rewards.
- critic/returns/max / critic/returns/min: Maximum / minimum of returns.
- critic/values/mean: Mean of value function (Value Function) estimates. Reflects the model's estimate of future total rewards for a state.
- critic/values/max / critic/values/min: Maximum / minimum of value function.
- tokens/response_length/mean: Average length of generated responses.
- tokens/response_length/max / tokens/response_length/min: Maximum / minimum length of generated responses.
- tokens/prompt_length/mean: Average length of prompts.
- tokens/prompt_length/max / tokens/prompt_length/min: Maximum / minimum length of prompts.

### Policy Related
- actor/lr: Learning rate of the current policy network (Actor). The learning rate is the step size for optimizer updates to model parameters.
- actor/ppo_ratio_high_clipfrac: High clipping ratio in PPO policy optimization.
- actor/ppo_ratio_low_clipfrac: Low clipping ratio in PPO policy optimization.
- actor/ppo_ratio_clipfrac: Clipping ratio in PPO policy optimization.
- actor/ratio_mean: Mean ratio of the policy network (Actor) (exponential of the ratio of new to old policy log probabilities).
- actor/ratio_max / actor/ratio_min: Maximum / minimum ratio of the policy network (Actor).
- actor/clipfrac: Clipping ratio of the policy network (Actor).
- actor/kl_loss: KL divergence penalty term between current policy and reference policy. Used to prevent the policy from deviating too far from the original model.
- actor/total_loss: Weighted sum of policy gradient loss, KL divergence loss, and entropy loss (if present). This is the actual loss used for model backpropagation.
- actor/approxkl: Approximate KL divergence between current policy and old policy. Measures the step size of each policy update.
- actor/policykl: Exact KL divergence between current policy and old policy.

### Evaluation Metrics
- critic/ref_log_prob/mean: Mean log probability output by the reference model. Used as a performance baseline for measuring old policy or reference policy.
- critic/old_log_prob/mean: Mean log probability output by the old policy (Actor before training). Used to measure differences between new and old policies.
- critic/entropy/mean: Mean entropy of the policy. Entropy measures the randomness or exploratory nature of the policy, with high entropy indicating stronger exploration.
- critic/reward_clip_frac: Proportion of reward clipping. Reflects how many reward values were clipped, and if too high, may require adjusting reward range or clipping thresholds.

#### PPO Loss Metrics
- actor/pg_loss: Policy gradient loss of the PPO algorithm. The goal is to minimize this loss to improve the policy.
- actor/weighted_pg_loss: Weighted value of policy gradient loss.
- actor/valid_samples: Number of valid samples in the current batch.
- actor/total_samples: Total number of samples in the current batch (i.e., batch size).
- actor/valid_sample_ratio: Proportion of valid samples in the current batch.
- actor/sample_weights_mean: Mean of all sample weights in the batch.
- actor/sample_weights_min / actor/sample_weights_max: Minimum / maximum of all sample weights in the batch.

#### SFT Loss Metrics
- actor/sft_loss: Supervised fine-tuning loss.
- actor/positive_sft_loss: Positive sample supervised fine-tuning loss.
- actor/negative_sft_loss: Negative sample supervised fine-tuning loss.
